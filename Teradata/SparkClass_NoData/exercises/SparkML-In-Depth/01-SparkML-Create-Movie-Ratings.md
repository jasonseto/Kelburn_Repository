## Lab 01: Creates Personal Movie Ratings

This lab's only goal is to create a file of your personal ratings on a scale of 1 to 5 for the following movies:

* Toy Story (1995)
* Independence Day (a.k.a. ID4) (1996)
* Dances with Wolves (1990)
* Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)
* Mission: Impossible (1996)
* Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)
* Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)
* Batman Forever (1995)
* Pretty Woman (1990)
* Men in Black (1997)
* Dumb & Dumber (1994)

Most people today will find these movies quite old. They are chosen because they map to movies in the ratings database we'll be using to build our recommendation engine.

To rate your movies, you should perform the following steps on your cluster:

```bash
cd /mnt/sparkclass/exercises/SparkML-In-Depth
./rateMovies.py
```

The script will create a data file called `personalRatings.txt`.

Once you've rated those movies, you have completed this lab.
