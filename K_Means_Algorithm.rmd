# K-means Algorithm

* Assume euclidean space/distance (the straight line distance between two points)
* start by picking k, the number of clusters
* initialize clusters by picking one point per cluster

1. For each point, place a cluster whose current centroid it is the nearest to
2. After all points are assigned update the locations
3. Reassign all points to their closest centroid

## How do we assign K, the number of K?

* since we do not know the value of K, we have to try different amounts and see what looks good
* Good is defined as the average distance between the distance and the centroid. Too few, then the average distance is too large, too many, and the clusters are not meaningful
* You want to pick a value of a curb that's the lowest point in the diminishing point of return on the average distance of the curve

## Choosing Initial K Points

### Sampling

* Cluster a sample of the data using hierarchical clustering to obtain k clusters
* Pick a point from each cluster (point closest to centroid)
* Sample fits into memory

### Pick Dispersed set of points
* Pick points at random
* Pick points that are as far away

# Hierarchical Clustering

* Agglomerative
* Divisive
