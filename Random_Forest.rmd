library("MASS")
library(randomForest)
```

# Setting up the data
## Setting the seed for sample data
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

## Setting up the fram
* The help statement allows you to view background information about the birthwt
* Data about what is indicative of bwt - birthweight in grams. There is also data about the predictor values like age, race
* There is also a binary predictor of Low (less than 2.5 kg)

```{r}
DataFrame <- birthwt
help("birthwt")
```

## Let's look at the structure and dimensions
* Notice that all the varaibles are integers
* 189 records, and 10 variables
* The summary function gives you summary statistics about the table
```{r}
str(DataFrame)
dim(DataFrame)
head(DataFrame)
summary(DataFrame)
```

## Check the number of unique values
```{r}
apply(DataFrame,2,function(x) length(unique(x))
```

```{r}
hist(DataFrame$age)
```
# Cleaning the data

* You need to convert categorical variables using as.factor



# Plotting AUC



# Plotting an ROC











```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
