install.packages("MASS")

```{r}
library("MASS")
library(randomForest)
```

# Setting up the data
## Setting the seed for sample data
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

## Setting up the frame
* The help statement allows you to view background information about the birthwt
* Data about what is indicative of bwt - birthweight in grams. There is also data about the predictor values like age, race
* There is also a binary predictor of Low (less than 2.5 kg). We want to leverage what udnerlying factors might be the most indicative of a low birth weight

```{r}
DataFrame <- birthwt
help("birthwt")
```

## Let's look at the structure and dimensions
* Notice that all the varaibles are integers
* 189 records, and 10 variables
* The summary function gives you summary statistics about the table
```{r}
str(DataFrame)
dim(DataFrame)
head(DataFrame)
summary(DataFrame)
```

## Check the number of unique values
```{r}
apply(DataFrame,2,function(x) length(unique(x)))
```
* This tells us that there are 9 variables + age, and for age, there are 24 unique values
* Smoke and history of hypertension are all binaries and categorical and need to be converted

```{r}
hist(DataFrame$age)
```
* Hist data frames gives us a histogram of the data. This tells us that majority of women are getting their pregnancies around 20- 25


# Cleaning the data

* You need to convert categorical variables using as.factor
* We need to use as factor to convert them from categorical to factor form otherwise the random forest algorithm will leverage the categorical variables as numbers
* We need to tell the algorithm that they are categorical so that they can split accordingly

1. Identify all the categorical variables
2. Convert them into factor in a for loop
```{r}
cols <- c("low", "race", "smoke", "ptl", "ht", "ui", "ftv")
for (i in cols){
  DataFrame[,i] = as.factor(DataFrame[,i])
}
str(DataFrame)
```
* Note that now all the factors are no longer identified as numbers, and are instead factors

# Splitting the dataset into Training and Validation datasets

* caTools has some prepackaged methods for splitting a dataset
install.packages("caTools")
```{r}
library("caTools")
```
?caTools

1. Identify the target variable using the Y
2. Set the training and test data set by using the split ratio = 0.7 to get a 70/30 sample size
3. Set the training data with the indicator, and then select the records without the ind as the remaining split ratio

```{r}
ind <- sample.split(Y = DataFrame$low, SplitRatio = 0.7)
trainDF <- DataFrame[ind,]
testDF <- DataFrame[!ind,]
```

## Random Forest parameters

### mTry
* Number of variables selected at each split
* Example, if you let mTry = 3 and samp size = 50, then you will select 3 variables and using 50 random records to try to develop the best splits using those 3 variables

* Lower mTry is generally better since you need fewer variables to develop an effective model. There are less correlations between each of the decision trees
1. Example, if you have 9 variables, and you select the mTry = 9, then you will get a bunch of combinations of the same variables
2. Lower mTry means decreasing correlation between trees (good thing), poorer tree strength for each tree (bad thing). This means that each tree on it's own will not be as strong
3. Need to find out how to balance between the two

* Sample Size
1. Sample size is similar, you should select a lower number than the number of existing rows

### Nodesize


### Regression
* Regression = floor (number of variables/3), this is the default.
* For our example in the Dataframe, that would be 3

### Categorical
* floor(sqrt(no. of independent variables))


# Plotting AUC



# Plotting an ROC











```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
